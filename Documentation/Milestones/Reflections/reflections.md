Before starting the Game Development course, I had no experience with Unity. I didn’t know how game engines worked, but I was always curious about how games are made - how characters move, how animations play, how levels are designed, and how music and sound effects are added. To get hands-on experience, I began with a basic Udemy course that focused on player movement, including walking and jumping. It was a small step, but completing that course gave me the motivation to keep learning. I followed it with a more detailed 2D game development course that walked through the process of designing backgrounds, handling enemy behaviour, creating menus, and adding sound. This course also introduced Unity’s layout and tools, helping me understand how different systems in Unity come together to build a functional game.

In addition to the Udemy courses, I also used Unity’s official tutorials, which were shared in our course materials. Tutorials like Roll-a-Ball, Unity Essentials, and 2D Adventure Game gave me practical examples to follow. These tutorials helped me understand Unity’s core concepts, such as working with GameObjects, scenes, UI elements, and basic scripting. Through this learning process, I gained the skills I needed to contribute to our group project. I went from having no knowledge of Unity to designing full levels, managing animations, handling player and enemy logic, and setting up menus and audio. This journey helped me build confidence not just in using Unity, but also in breaking down complex tools and learning them through practice.

I built the entire health system for both the player and the enemies. This included creating a user-friendly health bar UI and writing modular, maintainable code. I followed good coding practices like separating concerns into different scripts and applying the Single Responsibility Principle. I also used the Singleton pattern to manage the player’s health globally. This helped keep the project organized and scalable. Adding features like health recovery, damage zones, and invincibility windows gave the gameplay more depth and made it more balanced.

Working on the health system helped me improve my understanding of clean code structure and game logic in Unity. I learned how to organize a system so that it can be reused and maintained without creating confusion. This task taught me how small gameplay details like an invincibility delay or collectible behaviour—can make a big difference in how fair and enjoyable the game feels. It also pushed me to think about both the technical and player experience sides of game development.

I designed and implemented Level 1 of the game. I researched level design techniques and decided to use Unity’s Rule Tile system to build the terrain quickly and consistently. I also sourced and placed environment assets that matched the forest theme of “Lumberjack Warrior”. I designed puzzles that made the level more engaging and challenging, such as box movement and falling logs. These gameplay elements added variety and tested player skill and timing. I also parallax background script to implement an infinite parallax background with layered scrolling. In addition, I used downloaded sprite assets to set up enemy animations in Unity and coded logic that allowed players to damage enemies in combat. This brought life to the level and made it feel complete and interactive.

While working on this level, I learned how to turn a simple idea into a playable experience that feels polished and well-paced. Using the Rule Tile system helped me understand how tools can speed up design while still giving me control over the look of the level. Setting up puzzles taught me to think about timing, precision, and how to teach the player through gameplay instead of text. Implementing parallax backgrounds gave me insight into how depth and movement affect visual storytelling. Using downloaded sprites to build animation clips helped me get comfortable with Unity’s Animator system and showed me how to bring static visuals to life. Adding enemy damage logic also strengthened my understanding of hit detection and interaction between game objects. Overall, this part of the project helped me grow in both creative design and technical problem-solving.

Toward the end of the project, I focused on the user interface and some audio features. I created key menu screens like the main menu, pause screen, and game over screen. I made the main menu a separate scene to keep things organized and improve performance. I also added background music to the main menu.

This part of the project taught me how important the user interface and audio are to the overall player experience. Managing scene transitions and UI panels helped me understand the trade-offs between performance and flexibility. Adding sound effects also showed me how much of a difference audio makes in making gameplay feel responsive and satisfying. I gained practical experience using Unity’s audio and UI systems, and I saw how visual, and audio feedback can improve the feel of a game even when the mechanics stay the same. This work helped me think more about how a game looks and sounds, not just how it plays.

Looking back, I feel that my contributions touched on every part of the player experience from what the player sees and hears to how they interact with the game world. I learned how to break down complex tasks, research effective solutions, and apply best practices to real problems. Most importantly, I saw how small design and coding decisions could have a big impact on how the game feels to play.
