After weeks of planning, development and iteration, our game is finally complete.

We set out to create a 2D pixel-art platformer that blends classic mechanics with interactive puzzle elements and a
polished visual style. The final product delivers on that vision. The game features three distinct levels, each with its
own theme, obstacles and pacing. The final level ends in a boss battle that brings all the mechanics together in a
challenging but fair way.

Key features include:

- A responsive player controller with jumping, combat and interaction mechanics.
- Puzzle systems like pressure plates, moving platforms and timed torches.
- A lift system, a screen-by-screen transition setup and a dynamic loading screen.
- Polished UI elements like a controls screen, pause menu and health indicators.
- Background music and sound effects that match the tone and feedback of each scene.

Throughout development, we focused on player experience and game feel. We iterated on level layouts, enemy behavior and
interaction systems to ensure everything felt responsive and intuitive.

This project taught us the importance of planning gameplay systems early, managing scope, and prioritizing player
feedback. It also reinforced our skills in Unity, 2D animation, UI design, and team coordination.

We're proud of what we built and we’re excited to share the finished game with others.
